SiEPIC Ebeam PDK adapted from [siepic Ebeam PDK](https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) for gdsfactory.
It provides a fully python driven flow alternative for the most advanced users taking the [edx course](https://www.edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-and-data-ana)

## Installation

We recommend `uv`

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Installation for users

Use python 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE.

```
uv pip install cspdk --upgrade
```

Then you need to restart Klayout to make sure the new technology installed appears.
